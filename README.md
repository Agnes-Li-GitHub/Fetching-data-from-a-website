# Fetching-data-from-a-website

I design and develop a Web app that retrieves and displays ‘real-time’ passenger flight information from Hong Kong Airport Open Data. This REST web service provided by HK Airport returns historical data (including current calendar day) in JSON format. I only display current calendar date departure and arrival passenger flight information. The Web app should be nicely rendered on any desktop computer and smart phone.
